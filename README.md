SimonWeb Paging for iOS

This app was originally written for the SimmonWeb hospital paging systems at Grady and Vanderbilt hospitals when I was working in those respective systems. For those systems, the app is available for free in the iOS App Store as 'Simon Web Emory/Grady' and 'Vandy Paging'.  It is wholly unsupported.

Paging within other hospital systems which are using a SimonWeb-based system may be possible using this app with minor modifications. I'm making the source code available in case it is useful. I am not able to provide developer or user level support for this.
